ASSIGNMENT 

The objective of this assignment is to analyze datasets on user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends using three datasets: 
UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. The task involves cleaning and merging the data, exploring relationships between cooking sessions and user orders, 
identifying popular dishes, and analyzing demographic factors influencing user behavior. Key insights will be presented through visualizations, 
and a report will summarize findings and provide business recommendations.
