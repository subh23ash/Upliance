Business Recommendations:
****************************************

1)Focus on Popular Dishes : 


**) Highlight Top Dishes: The top 10 most popular dishes should be prominently featured on the menu and in marketing campaigns. Offering specials or discounts on these dishes could help increase sales even more.

**) Personalized Recommendations: Leverage data on users' favorite meals and popular dishes to build a personalized recommendation system. This can suggest popular dishes tailored to users' preferences, particularly for repeat customers.


2) Optimize Cooking Sessions:


**) Focus on High Rated Sessions : Identify what makes high-rated sessions successful and try to replicate these in future sessions. Promoting these sessions can enhance the user experience and increase orders.

**) Improve Low-Performing Sessions : Analyze sessions with low orders and ratings. Look into details like dish type, cooking time, and meal type to find areas for improvement.

**) Time Based Promotion : If certain times see higher orders, consider offering promotions such as Happy Hour discounts or special menus during peak hours.


3) Target Demographic Groups with Tailored Marketing:


**) Age-based marketing : Younger users may respond better to meal deals and promotions, while older users might prefer a more refined or premium menu. Tailoring offers based on age can help target the right promotions.

**) Location-Based Offers : Since different regions prefer different dishes, create location-specific promotions to highlight the most popular dishes in each area. This can boost local engagement and sales.

**) Re-engage Long-Term Users : Long-term users who place more orders can be rewarded with loyalty perks or exclusive offers to keep them engaged.


4) Improve Order Fulfillment and User Experience :


**) Follow Up on Missing Ratings: Missing ratings may signal user dissatisfaction or lack of interest. Sending reminders or feedback requests to users can help gather these ratings and improve the service.

**) Address Cancellations: Since order cancellations are not uncommon, investigating why users cancel their orders can offer valuable insights.


5)Enhance the Customer Journey :


**) Personalized Messaging : Use customer data to personalize communications like emails or push notifications, making customers feel valued.
